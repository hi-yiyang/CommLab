   Fixed, but not friendly to content.
   Make all content inside a div with relative position.

## Evaluation

I have spent tens of hours going through all the materials and techniques, another tens of hours drafting and crafting the webpage. Every minor detail has been examined, and every screen size has been made into consideration. 

Only one initial expectation has not been made - change of video size as the page is scrolled down.
